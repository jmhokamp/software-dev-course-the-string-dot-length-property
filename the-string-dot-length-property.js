/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

*/

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne;   // Length of stringOne
let lengthTwo;   // Length of stringTwo
let lengthThree; // Length of stringThree

// Your code here
let lenString1 = stringOne.length;
console.log(stringOne, "has", lenString1, "characters" );

let lenString2 = stringTwo.length;
console.log(stringTwo, "has", lenString2, "characters" );

let lenString3 = stringThree.length;
console.log(stringThree, "has", lenString3, "characters" );
